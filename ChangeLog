          *  Fixed mirroring issues in PS, and now magnification works 
	        for supported shapes.
          *  In order to handle my gds needs, added a datatype parameter 
                to the config format to supplement the gdsno.
	  *  Added a first permanent dummy psStyle which is hidden so that
	        unused layers could point to it.
